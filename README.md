Hello Guys !


This is a Project I Made for the "Object Oriented Programming" class at my university. 
Based on some of the requirements given to us by our teacher, this project was created.



      Here is the requirements 
      -------------------------

      For the term project, you need to design a project that includes the structures mentioned below.



      Inheritance (at least 2),

      Abstract class or interface (at least 1),

      Overloading (at least 3),

      Method (at least 20),

      Constructor (for each class),

      Exception (at least 2),

      Determining access (specified in all sections),

      Nested class (at least 1).


      The designed project must be coded in Java language.

      The project should be based on a certain logic and should be suitable for solving a problem. 
      (You will determine the subject of the project.)

      (Library program-style automations will not be accepted.)



Here are the requirements. The logic of the project I am doing is completely imaginary. 
The main logic is to go from one planet to another planet :)
